Question:

The program must accept N integers and an integer X as the input. The program must find the sum of the first X integers as S1 and then find the sum of the last X integers as S2. Finally, the program must print the sum of S1 and S2 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= X <= N
Input Format:

The first line contains the integer N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).
The third line contains the integer X.
Output Format:

The first line contains the sum of S1 and S2.
Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
3
Output:
27
Explanation:

The first 3 integers are 1, 2 and 3 and their sum (S1) is 6 (1 + 2 + 3).
The last 3 integers are 6, 7 and 8 and their sum (S2) is 21 (6 + 7 + 8).
The sum of S1 and S2 is 27 (6+21).
Hence the output is 27.

Solution:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x, sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0, i;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n];

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    scanf("%d", &x);

    for(i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        sum1 += arr[i];
    }

    for(i = n - x; i < n; i++) {
        sum2 += arr[i];
    }

    printf("%d\n", sum1 + sum2);

    return 0;
}
